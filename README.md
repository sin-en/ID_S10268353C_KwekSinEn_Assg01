# Project name: Alec Benjamin's website
This website was desgined for fans of Alec Benjamin, a American singer-songwriter. The website allows fans to access and buy tour tickets, buy his merch, learn about how he started and access his discography. This allows fans to know more about him and support him.


## Design Process
This website will be the one place fans will frequent to access his music and merch as it will include access to his tour dates, merch and discography.   

As a fan, I want to watch his interviews and learn about the meaning behind his songs to understand more about him as an artist.

Testing
<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
